#  Node js

`What is Node ?` 

is an open-source , cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. 


`Benefits of node js`
- Great performance
- Code is written in "plain old JavaScript"
- access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages using (npm) node package manager .


 - Node.js is portable. It is available on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, WebOS, and NonStop OS. You can use Node.js 
it is well-supported by many web hosting providers.
- It has a very active third party ecosystem and developer community, with lots of people who are willing to help.

You can use Node.js to create a simple web server using the Node HTTP package.

# Express

###  is the most popular Node web framework

` was initially released in November 2010 `

- There are mothods ( POST , GET , SET, etcâ€¦.) also there are many of packeges .

- Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.



`Hello world Express`

```const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
});

app.listen(port, function() {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`)
});
 
 ```

### Middleware 

 is functions end the HTTP request-response cycle by returning some response to the HTTP client . 

 - I can use third party middleware but before that I need Install it into my app using npm ( $ npm install morgan )
 
 - You can use the express.static middleware to serve static files, including your images, CSS and JavaScript (static() is the only middleware function that is actually part of Express).

#  TDD

- design : *in the form of refactoring*

- write descrption
- run the test for enhanced.
- the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria

# CI/CD

- CI  "Continuous Integration": is a workflow strategythat helps ensure everyone's changes will integrate with the current version of the project. This lets you catch bugs, reduce merge conflicts, and have confidence your software is working. 

 - CD "Continuous Delivery": is the practice of developing software in such a way that you could release it at any time. When coupled with CI, continuous delivery lets you develop features with modular code in more manageable increments.
